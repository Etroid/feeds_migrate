## Feeds Migrate
Feeds Migrate is a tool that helps import data into your Drupal 8 website. It provides a user interface for migrations, 
so users don’t have to set up the migrations with code. The goal is to provide a tool anyone can use, regardless of 
tech background, to import data into their site.

Why does it matter?
If you are trying to upgrade to Drupal 8 and have existing content, you probably don’t want to spend hours typing in 
the content through the Drupal admin interface. You’d want to use a tool to import the data into your new platform… 
Feeds Migrate is that tool.

*This module has deep roots in the Feeds community and mimics the Feeds module workflow very closely.

**The development version is a work in progress and not functional at the moment. 
DO NOT INSTALL IT ON PRODUCTION.
